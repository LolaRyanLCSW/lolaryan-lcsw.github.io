      <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm Lola Ryan, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker based in Oregon. I work with caring professionals experiencing burnout, college students navigating transitions, and immigrant communities — including Russian-speaking clients — who are building lives across cultures.</p>
        <p>I came to this work through my own experience. As an immigrant, a professional, and a mother of young children, I know firsthand what it means to carry a lot at once — to feel the pull between responsibility and your own needs, between the world you came from and the one you're building.</p>
        <p>Before private practice, I trained at OHSU's Intercultural Psychiatric Program and worked with the UN Population Fund in Uzbekistan. I bring that international and cross-cultural experience into every client relationship.</p>

      <h2>How We Work Together</h2>
      <p>We'll take time to build trust before we approach anything sensitive. Therapy isn't linear — sometimes we move forward, sometimes we take a step back or sideways, and that's okay. I draw on your internal wisdom to help resolve what's troubling you, using practices tailored to your feedback and needs.</p>
      <p>I believe you already hold much of what you need. My role is to help you access it.</p>
