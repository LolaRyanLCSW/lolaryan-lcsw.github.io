      <p>Secure, convenient online therapy for Oregon residents.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>How Telehealth Works</h2>
      <p>All sessions are conducted via a secure, HIPAA-compliant video platform. You'll receive a link before each session — no app download required. All you need is a private space, a reliable internet connection, and a device with a camera and microphone.</p>
      <p>Sessions are 50 minutes, the same as in-person therapy. The only difference is that you don't have to leave your home.</p>

      <h2>Is Telehealth a Good Fit?</h2>
      <p>Telehealth works well for many people. It may be especially convenient if you:</p>
      <ul class="th-list">
        <li>Live outside of Portland or in a rural area</li>
        <li>Have a busy schedule with limited commute time</li>
        <li>Feel more comfortable in your own environment</li>
        <li>Are managing a health condition or disability that makes travel difficult</li>
        <li>Prefer the privacy of connecting from home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some clients find telehealth equally or more effective than in-person therapy. If you're unsure, the free initial consultation is a good opportunity to ask questions and get a feel for how it works.</p>

  <!-- Section 3: Creating a Private Space -->
  <section class="th-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Creating a Private Space</h2>
      <p>To get the most from telehealth sessions, it helps to find a quiet, private location where you won't be interrupted. This might be a bedroom, a parked car, or anywhere you feel comfortable speaking openly.</p>
      <p>If privacy at home is a concern, let Lola know — she can suggest options and adjust accordingly.</p>

  <!-- Section 4: Oregon Licensure -->
  <section class="th-section th-section--alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Oregon Licensure</h2>
      <p>Lola is licensed to practice in the state of Oregon. Telehealth services are available to clients physically located in Oregon at the time of their session, regardless of where they live within the state.</p>
