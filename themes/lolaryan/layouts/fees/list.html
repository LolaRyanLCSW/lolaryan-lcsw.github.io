      <h2>Insurance &amp; Coverage</h2>
      <p>Lola is credentialed with Care Oregon and accepts Oregon Health Plan (OHP). If you have OHP coverage through Care Oregon, your sessions may be covered at little or no cost to you.</p>
      <p>For clients with other insurance, Lola is currently an out-of-network provider. A superbill (itemized receipt) can be provided upon request, which you may submit to your insurance for potential out-of-network reimbursement. Coverage varies by plan — contact your insurer to confirm your out-of-network benefits before scheduling.</p>
      <p>Lola does not currently accept other commercial insurance directly.</p>
