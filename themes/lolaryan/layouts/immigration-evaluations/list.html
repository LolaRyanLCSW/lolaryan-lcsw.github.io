  <!-- Section 1: What Is an Immigration Psychological Evaluation -->
  <section class="imm-section">
    <div class="container">
      <p>An immigration psychological evaluation is a clinical assessment conducted by a licensed mental health professional and submitted as evidence in immigration proceedings. The resulting report documents a client's psychological history, current mental health status, and — depending on the case type — the psychological impact of deportation, family separation, or return to a country of origin.</p>
      <p>This is work Lola pursues deliberately. As an immigrant and a clinician trained in intercultural mental health, she brings both professional expertise and genuine understanding of what her clients are navigating.</p>

  <!-- Section 2: Background & Qualifications -->
  <section class="imm-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Background &amp; Qualifications</h2>
      <p>Lola Ryan is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in Oregon with clinical training from the Intercultural Psychiatric Program at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU). Her background includes work with the UN Population Fund in Uzbekistan, where she worked directly with communities affected by displacement and cross-cultural mental health challenges.</p>
      <p>She is herself an immigrant. This matters clinically: clients recounting trauma, persecution, or the weight of acculturation are speaking to someone who understands that experience from the inside — not just as a clinician, but as a person.</p>
      <p>Lola conducts evaluations in English and Russian. For Russian-speaking clients, this means the clinical interview is conducted in the client's native language without a translator, producing a more complete and credible record. She has working knowledge of Tajik and Uzbek.</p>
      <p>Her reports are written to be clearly understood by immigration judges, attorneys, and USCIS adjudicators, and are prepared to professional forensic standards.</p>
