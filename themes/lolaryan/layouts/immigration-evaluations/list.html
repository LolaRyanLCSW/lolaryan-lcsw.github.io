      <h2>What Is an Immigration Psychological Evaluation?</h2>
      <p>An immigration psychological evaluation is a formal clinical assessment conducted by a licensed mental health professional. The evaluation produces a written report documenting a client's psychological history, current mental health status, and — depending on the case type — the potential psychological impact of deportation, separation from family, or return to a country of origin.</p>
      <p>These reports are submitted as supporting evidence in immigration proceedings. Courts, immigration judges, and USCIS adjudicators use them to better understand the human impact of their decisions. A well-prepared evaluation can be a meaningful part of a case.</p>
