      <h2>Burnout &amp; Caring Professionals</h2>
      <p>If you work in a caring profession — as a nurse, teacher, therapist, social worker, or caregiver — you may have learned to put everyone else first. It can feel like there's nothing left for you at the end of the day, or that needing support is somehow a failure.</p>
      <p>It isn't. The same skills that make you good at caring for others can make it hard to care for yourself. Therapy offers a space that's entirely yours — no one else's needs, no performance, no roles to fill.</p>
      <p>We can work on burnout, compassion fatigue, boundary-setting, and finding your way back to the things that matter to you — including yourself.</p>

      <h2>College Students &amp; Life Transitions</h2>
      <p>The college years — and the transitions that surround them — can be some of the most disorienting of your life. You may be navigating new independence, identity questions, academic pressure, relationship changes, or the gap between who you were and who you're becoming.</p>
      <p>These experiences are real and they deserve real support — not just advice to 'push through it.'</p>
      <p>We can work on anxiety, depression, identity, relationships, and building a life that feels like yours. I meet you where you are, not where you think you should be.</p>

      <h2>Immigrant Communities &amp; Multicultural Therapy</h2>
      <p>Living between cultures means carrying things that are hard to explain to people who haven't done it — the weight of acculturation, the complexity of identity across languages, the intergenerational dynamics that don't translate neatly.</p>
      <p>I understand this from the inside. As an immigrant myself, I bring both clinical training and lived experience to this work. I work with clients from a range of backgrounds and offer therapy in English and Russian.</p>
      <p>We can work on acculturation stress, identity, trauma, family dynamics, anxiety, and depression — in a space that doesn't require you to explain the basics.</p>
